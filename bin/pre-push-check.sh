# KitCLA Pre-Push Check Script
#
# This script runs both tests and code checks before pushing code.
# It ensures code quality and correctness by running:
#   1. Full test suite (./bin/run-tests.sh)
#   2. Code quality checks (./bin/run-code-checks.sh)
#
# Usage:
#   ./bin/pre-push-check.sh
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 - All checks passed
#   1 - Tests failed
#   2 - Code checks failed
